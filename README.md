# Puppet debs #
This is the packaging project for Deb packages of Puppet.

* The *master* branch means nothing.
* There are branches for upstream and pristine tar, these should only be modified when a new upstream version is released
* There are branches for lenny, lucid and squeeze currently.
* Branches/builds for other distributions will be added very soon.

Package can built using the following commands (assuming you on the lenny branch):

      git  buildpackage  --git-arch=amd64 --git-dist=lenny  -sa

# Prebuilt packages #
You should be able to find deb of Puppet Labs latest versions of Puppet on [apt.puppetlabs.com](http://apt.puppetlabs.com).

# Issues #
If you wish to report packaging issues, request or ideas, you are welcome to file issues at our [Red Mine](http://projects.puppetlabs.com/projects/puppet-community-pkg-repo/issues) Project.
