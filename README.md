This is the packaging project for Deb packages of Puppet.

* The *master* branch means nothing.
* There is a branch for upstream and pristine tar, these should only be modified when a new upstream version is released
* There is a branch for lenny, lucid and squeeze currently.

Package can built using the following commands (assuming you on the lenny branch):

      git  buildpackage  --git-arch=amd64 --git-dist=lenny  -sa
